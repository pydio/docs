# Pydio Docs Repository Structure
The Pydio documentation repository is organized into multiple branches and components for managing and building documentation.

# Main Branch
The main branch contains the MkDocs configuration, tools, and utilities to convert and aggregate documents.

## MkDocs Materials
* overrides/
* resources/
* mkdocs.yml
* requirements.txt
* resources/versions.json: We use Mike to deploy multiple versions of the docs.
Mike generates versions.json automatically; however, we maintain resources/versions.json to manually control versions and their labels.

This file overrides the Mike-generated versions.json.

## Document Conversion Tools
Located under the tools/ directory, these scripts handle the migration and aggregation of legacy documents from multiple repositories into a unified structure.

### git_script.sh

#### Prerequisites
Before running the script, clone the legacy repositories locally to:

```
LOCAL_REPO_ADMIN_GUIDE="/home/pydio/go/src/github.com/pydio/pydio-doc-admin-guide"
LOCAL_REPO_DEVELOPER_GUIDE="/home/pydio/go/src/github.com/pydio/pydio-doc-developer-guide"
LOCAL_REPO_KB="/home/pydio/go/src/github.com/pydio/pydio-doc-howto"
```

#### Functionality
`git_script.sh` scans these repositories across their respective branches and performs:

* Adds .nav.yaml files to each folder, containing frontmatter (slug, title, etc.).
* Inserts frontmatter metadata into each .md file:
* title, slug, weight (used to order pages).
* Fixes image links within .md files.
* Replaces [:summary] placeholders with actual section TOCs.


### local-build.sh
This script is used for local builds of the documentation using MkDocs and Mike.

#### Mkdocs plugins build/setup

Setup a clean python env

```
python -m venv /home/pydio/.venv
```

Propagate python Envs

```
source /home/pydio/.venv/bin/activate
```

pip install mkdocs mike
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-minify-plugin pymdown-extensions mkdocs-glightbox

Install specific mkdocs plugin

```
pip install git+https://github.com/pydio/mkdocs-awesome-nav
```

`pydio/mkdocs-awesome-nav` is an specific plugin enabling following features:
- Understand the frontmatter of .md files such as title, slug, weight
- Understand the .nav.yaml of each section for menu & navigation bar

For example:

**Frontmatter:**

```
---
slug: install-static-binaries
title: Install Static Binaries
description: Installing Pydio Cells on your server using our pre-compiled binaries.
menu: Static Binaries
language: und
weight: 1
menu_name: menu-admin-guide-v7-enterprise

---
Page content

```

**.nav.yaml:**

```
title: Quick Start
abstract: This section provides a full-spectrum overview of Pydio Cells installation, configuration and usage.
menu: Quick Start
language: und
weight: 1
menu_name: menu-admin-guide-v7-enterprise

slug: quick-start
```

## Document Branches
The actual documentation contents are stored in version-specific branches:

* cells-v5

* cells-v4 (latest)

* pydio-v8

Each branch contains its own GitHub workflow file:

`.github/workflows/build-docs.yml` â€” triggers the documentation rebuild on push events.


## Artifact Branch

* gh-pages

GitHub Actions use MkDocs and Mike to build the documentation and store the resulting artifacts in this branch.

A separate GitHub Pages workflow listens to changes on gh-pages and triggers the website update process.

## Adding new branch

When you need a new branch:
* Chekout new branch from one of document branches
* Update [main branch] resources/versions.json file
