A **Flow** represent the definition of a sequence of **Actions** that are basic building blocks chained together to process data. The job **Trigger** starts in response to various event types. **Tasks** are actual instance of a job that are running. 

Data can be either explicitely loaded from internal Cells services using **Queries** or generated by the initial job trigger, and is carried by **Messages** from one action to another. 

Between each action, **Filters** can transform the message Data, or apply an arbitrary condition.
