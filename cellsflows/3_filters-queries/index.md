Filters and Queries modules are the components used to either filter a message content or dynamically load contents from Cells internals data to feed Actions inputs. 

As explained in the [Data Types](./data-types-queries-filters) section, these blocks are "typed" and use combination of criteria to build filtering or loading conditions. Below are describe the low-level blocks used for building conditions. When they are named "Selectors", it means that they can be used either in Filters or Queries components.

* [Files/Folders Selector](../files-folders-selector/)
* [Users Selector](../users-selector/)
* [Roles Selector](../roles-selector/)
* [Workspaces Selector](../workspaces-selector/)
* [ACL Selector](../acl-selector/)
* [Task Message Filter](../task-message-filter/)
* [Request Metadata Filter](../request-metadata-filter/)
* [Arbitrary Data Selector](../arbitrary-data-selector/)
* [Job Trigger Filter](../job-trigger-filter/)
* [DataSource Selector](../datasource-selector/)
