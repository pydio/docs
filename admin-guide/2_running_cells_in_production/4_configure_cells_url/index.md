Cells acts an autonomous web server via the [Cells Gateway](./glossary). Similarly to Apache, Ngninx or Caddy, Cells provides
ways to bind the gateway to multiple URLs. This section provides information about managing these multiple "sites" as well additional
information to configure TLS and to properly setup Cells behind reverse proxy.
