As explained in the section above, Cells can externalize all storage and services layers to more easily provide a stateless, replicable image. Each of these external services are open source and can themselves be deployed in a highly-available setup. 

This page gathers information about each service and links to the documentation for their installation (that will depend on your cloud). Being a core requirement of Cells, MySQL/MariaDB is not handled here.

## ETCD: distributed configurations and services registry 

**etcd** is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.

Cells uses Etcd for sharing configuration across cluster nodes, and keep a dynamic "registry" of all Cells services currently running in the cluster.

## Hashicorp VAULT: secure storage for master keys and certificates

Manage Secrets & Protect Sensitive Data : secure, store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.

Cells uses Vault to replace the file-base keyring by a distributed and secure storage.

## NATS: message broker and distributed queues

NATS is a connective technology built for the ever increasingly hyper-connected world. It is a single technology that enables applications to securely communicate across any combination of cloud vendors, on-premise, edge, web and mobile, and devices. NATS consists of a family of open source products that are tightly integrated but can be deployed easily and independently. NATS is being used globally by thousands of companies, spanning use-cases including microservices, edge computing, mobile, IoT and can be used to augment or replace traditional messaging.

Cells can connect to a Nats server for messages broadcasting inside the application, replacing the in-house gRPC broker used in simpler deployments.

Jetstream is the built-in persistence engine of NATS. It enables messages to be stored and replayed at a later time. Unlike NATS Core which requires you to have an active subscription to process messages as they happen, JetStream allows the NATS server to capture messages and replay them to consumers as needed. 

In a standalone deployment, Cells uses a built-in queue, storing messages locally on disk. In a clustered environment where Cells runs in stateless mode, we use NATS JetStream to have distributed, fault-tolerant and scalable FIFO queues.

**Warning**: NATS requires additional configuration to activate JetStream in cluster environment.

## Redis: shared cache

Redis is the open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker.

It is used by Cells for ephemeral and shared caching

## Mongo DB: NoSQL database
 
Mongo DB offers a flexible document data model along with support for ad-hoc queries, secondary indexing, and real-time aggregations to provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data.

It is used by many Cells services that are best-fitted for storing data in a NoSQL format.
