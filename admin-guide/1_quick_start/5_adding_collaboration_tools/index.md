Collaborating on Office Documents is a great addition to Content Collaboration Platform like Pydio Cells. We provide the following adapters for third-party services that will allow in-app collaborative edition of such documents :

- [[Ent] Only Office](../ent-only-office/)
- [Collabora Online](../collabora-online/)
