title: Admin Tree Service
weight: 0
---







This service is an entry point for admin operations in the internal tree.  
Unlike the standard 'user' tree operations, that must be always prefixed with a workspace slug, admins can list all data starting from the root of all datasources.

* [POST /a/tree/admin/list](../post-a-tree-admin-list/)
* [POST /a/tree/admin/stat](../post-a-tree-admin-stat/)
